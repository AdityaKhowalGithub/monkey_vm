# Monkey VM

This is a simple virtual machine (VM) implementation for the Monkey programming language. The VM is responsible for executing bytecode instructions generated by the Monkey compiler. This is a fork of iridium and personal project for learning rust and how language interpreters work.

At the moment we have two main structs: `VM` and 'instruction' and 'opcode' enums.
